# AutomatedMazeTraversal
Project from 2023 where I created an algorithm to automatically traverse a maze, with a bunch of bells and whistles for the animation demonstrating it.\

Visual Studio is required to run this program. After downloading the folder, run TextTools.sln, which will open VS and show the files I actually wrote. From within Visual Studio select Source.cpp and run it. This program utilizes the included TextTools library for creating the ASCII art used. Apologizes I don't have a more convient export of the program.
