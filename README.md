# AutomatedMazeTraversal
Project from 2022 where I created an algorithm to automatically traverse a maze, with a bunch of bells and whistles for the animation demonstrating it. All assignments in this class relied heavily on the professor's custom text tools library to give us expeirence working with properity libraries.

To see the animation, run TextTools.exe. Source code is contained within the TextTools folder.
